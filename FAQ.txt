While mounting with external volume, if the host contains files that may be overwrited by the installation, you may be prompted with something like this:

Configuration file '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf'
==> File on system created by you or by a script.
==> File also in package provided by package maintainer.
What would you like to do about it ? Your options are:
Y or I : install the package maintainer's version
N or O : keep your currently-installed version
D : show the differences between the versions
Z : start a shell to examine the situation
The default action is to keep your current version.
* nginx.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?

Just press ENTER if you fell like keeping the files from the host.
